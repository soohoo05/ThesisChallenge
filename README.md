# ThesisChallenge


Flaws in design: Two "create your account buttons," the top one doesn't seem necessary and is redundant 
(pending the lorem text does not have to do with an account creation).


Flaws/Skips in Challenge Copy:

1. Unable to find a copy of the purple background on the top, opted to skip from making whole background purple. Navbar content,
header on top of domain form and learn should be in white text.

2. Only 2 event listeners to open new windows for "Home" and "Why Us" created, opted to skip other event listeners as they would
all be "document.querySelector('ID').addEventListener('click',()=>window.open(/*Unknown Link*/))" and therefore redundant to
the challenge. Also could have changed all to anchor elements, but the aformentioned would also apply with not knowing links 
to send them too.
